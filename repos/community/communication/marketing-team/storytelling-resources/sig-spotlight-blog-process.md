The contributor comms team has an ongoing effort to create blog posts which shine a spotlight on various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) of the Kubernetes project. The goal of these posts is to draw attention to the wonderful work each SIG is doing, and to amplify the needs of these SIGs, hopefully encouraging new or existing contributors to join in on the SIG's efforts. Writing a SIG Spotlight blog post is an excellent task for new contributors, who will learn about other parts of the Kubernetes project while making a visible, meaningful contribution.

The steps to create a SIG Spotlight blog post are as follows:

1) Choose a sig (Not Windows, Multicluster, or Docs)
2) Join that SIG’s channel in Slack and say something along the lines of “Hello! I’m a member of the contributor comms team of SIG-ContribEx and I’m interested in writing a blog spotlighting your SIG. Who should I interview for this feature?”
3) Interview those people - usually the SIG chairs. We generally recommend doing the interview asynchronously via a Google Doc because written responses are easier to work with. The SIG-Multicluster one was done with a recorded zoom interview but it took a long time to complete.
4) Write a blog post. The post should be in markdown format and we like to do a round of review on a rough draft before creating a PR. We recommend either hackmd.io or Google Docs for this. Google Docs can be converted to markdown fairly easily.
